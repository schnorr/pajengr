#+TITLE: Maintenance ORG file for pajengr package
#+AUTHOR: Lucas Mello Schnorr
#+STARTUP: overview indent
#+TAGS: noexport(n) deprecated(d)
#+EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS: export
#+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport

The package has been created with Rcpp's version of =package.skeleton=,
by running the following code. This is no longer necessary because the
package has already been created and modified. The contents of the
pajengr directory created by the =Rcpp.package.skeleton= have been
copied to the root directory of this repository.

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
library(Rcpp);
Rcpp.package.skeleton("pajengr");
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

Creating NAMESPACE ...
Creating Read-and-delete-me ...

Making help files ...
Done.
Further steps are described in './pajengr/Read-and-delete-me'.

Adding Rcpp settings
 >> added Imports: Rcpp
 >> added LinkingTo: Rcpp
 >> added useDynLib directive to NAMESPACE
 >> added importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp) directive to NAMESPACE
 >> added example src file using Rcpp attributes
 >> added Rd file for rcpp_hello_world
 >> compiled Rcpp attributes
#+end_example

Every time some new function is exported, we need to recompile the
attributes in the following way, so our R API gets updated.

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
library(Rcpp);
unlink("src/RcppExports.cpp")
compileAttributes(".");
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

The package can be checked and installed the following way (for
development purposes only). Please note that the standard installation
procedure [[./README.org][has already been described in the README file]]. Note that the
following commands should be executed considering the existence of a
=pajengr= directory with the contents of this repository. If you are
within the aforementioned directory, replace pajengr by the dot.

#+begin_src shell :results output
#R CMD check .
R CMD INSTALL .
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Contents of the REad-and-delete-me file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- Edit the help file skeletons in 'man', possibly combining help files for multiple functions.
- Edit the exports in 'NAMESPACE', and add necessary imports.
- Put any C/C++/Fortran code in 'src'.
- If you have compiled code, add a useDynLib() directive to 'NAMESPACE'.
- Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.
- Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.
#+END_EXAMPLE

And then, test to verify if the installation is working.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both
library(pajengr)
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
pajeng_read("../pajeng/traces/simu-mardi.trace")[[1]] %>% as.tibble -> x
x %>%
    group_by(Container) %>% summarize(N=n())
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
# A tibble: 51 x 2
   Container     N
